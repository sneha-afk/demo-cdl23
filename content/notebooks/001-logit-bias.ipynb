    "From the OpenAI API, [logit bias](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-logit_bias) is taken as a mapping of tokens to their bias levels ranging from -100, a potential complete ban of the token, to 100, a potenital guarantee of selection. Lesser magnitude values like -1 or 1 will configure the possibility for the token's \"selection\": the chance it will appear in the output. "
