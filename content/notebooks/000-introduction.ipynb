    "**Semantic Kernel** (SK) is an open-source software development kit developed by Microsoft to facilitate AI orchestration and integration within applications. SK ties in connections between LLM services, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT models, and other features like memory and native functions to provide an accessible platform for AI development. It acts as a springboard for quickly utilizing the growing technology of generative AI by abstracting the usage of various components and streamlining API connections, making the development process easier and sustainable.\n"
