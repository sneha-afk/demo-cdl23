    "**Semantic Kernel** (SK) is an open-source software development kit developed by Microsoft to facilitate AI orchestration and integration within applications. SK ties in connections between LLM services, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT models, and other features like memory and native functions. By abstracting the usage of various components and streamlining API interactions, SK acts as a springboard for quickly utilizing the growing field of generative AI and makes the development process more accessible and sustainable for long-term deployments.\n"
